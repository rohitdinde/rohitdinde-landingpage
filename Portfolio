            <p class="card-text">Farmers around the world rely on their agricultural work for livelihood. However, pests pose a significant threat 
                to crops, with animals and birds being the main culprits. Birds and monkeys, in particular, cause extensive 
                damage to plants and agricultural produce, leading to losses for farmers. To address this issue, a bird repellent 
                system has been developed that utilizes specific frequencies to deter harmful birds. The system involves the 
                detection of birds using a webcam, followed by image analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 
                classification. Through this approach, 97.30% accuracy was achieved after 50 epochs, with a total of 128 features 
                extracted from each image. The successful classification triggers the playback of the repellent frequency, 
                effectively protecting crops from further harm. This system incorporates technologies such as CNN, image 
                processing, and deep learning to create an efficient bird repelling solution. Keywords-- Convolutional Neural 
                Network, Image Processing, Deep Learning, Bird Repelling System In order to ensure the survival and optimal 
                growth of fruit trees, plantations are often established in natural and spacious areas. However, these plantations 
                become attractive feeding grounds for birds residing in the surrounding areas. As a result, harmful birds 
                continuously pose a threat to the plantations, causing significant damage and resulting in approximately 30% 
                loss in annual fruit production.</p>
